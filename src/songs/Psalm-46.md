# Psalm 46  
  
_Shane and Shane_  
  
**Verse 1**  
O come behold the works of God  
The nations at His feet  
He breaks the bow and bends the spear  
and tells the wars to cease  
O Mighty One of Israel  
you are on our side  
We walk by faith in God who burns the chariots with fire  
  
**Chorus**  
Lord of Hosts, You're with us, with us in the fire  
with us as a shelter, with us in the storm  
You will lead us through the fiercest battle  
oh where else would we go, but with the Lord of Hosts  
  
**Verse 2**  
O God of Jacob, fierce and great  
You lift Your voice to speak  
The earth it bows and all  
the mountains move into the sea  
O Lord You know the hearts of men  
and still you let them live  
O God, who makes the mountains melt  
come wrestle us and win  
  
**Bridge**  
Though oceans roar, You are the Lord of all  
The one who calms the wind and waves and makes my heart be still  
Though the earth gives way, the mountains move into the sea  
The nations rage, I know my God is in control  
Though oceans roar, You are the Lord of all  
The one who calms the wind and waves and makes my heart be still  
Though the earth gives way, the mountains move into the sea  
The nations rage, I know my God is in control
