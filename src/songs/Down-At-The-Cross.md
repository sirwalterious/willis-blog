# Down At The Cross

_Elisha Albright Hoffman_

**Verse 1**  
Down at the cross where my Savior died  
Down where for cleansing from sin I cried  
There to my sin was the blood applied  
Glory to His name  

**Chorus**  
Glory to His name, glory to His name  
There to my sin was the blood applied  
Glory to His name  

**Verse 2**  
I am so wondrously saved from sin  
Jesus so sweetly abides within  
There at the cross where He took me in  
Glory to His name  

**Verse 3**  
Oh, precious fountain that saves from sin    
I am so glad I have entered in  
There Jesus saves me and keeps me clean   
Glory to His name

**Verse 4**  
Come to this fountain so rich and sweet  
Cast thy poor soul at the Saviorâ€™s feet  
Plunge in today, and be made complete  
Glory to His name
