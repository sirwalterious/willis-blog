# When I Survey The Wondrous Cross  
  
_Isaac Watts_  
  
**Verse 1**  
When I survey the wondrous cross  
On which the Prince of glory died  
My richest gain I count but loss  
And pour contempt on all my pride  
  
**Verse 2**  
Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast  
Save in the death of Christ my God!  
All the vain things that charm me most  
I sacrifice them to His blood  
  
**Verse 3**  
See from His head, His hands, His feet  
Sorrow and love flow mingled down!  
Did eâ€™er such love and sorrow meet  
Or thorns compose so rich a crown?  
  
**Verse 4**  
Were the whole realm of nature mine  
That were a present far too small  
Love so amazing, so divine  
Demands my soul, my life, my all
