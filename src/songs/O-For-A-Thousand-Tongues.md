# O For A Thousand Tongues  
  
_Charles Wesley_  
  
**Verse 1**  
Oh, for a thousand tongues to sing  
My great Redeemer’s praise  
The glories of my God and king  
The triumphs of His grace!  
  
**Verse 2**  
My gracious Master and my God  
Assist me to proclaim  
To spread through all the earth abroad  
The honors of Thy name  
  
**Verse 3**  
Jesus! the name that charms our fears  
That bids our sorrows cease—  
’Tis music in the sinner’s ears  
’Tis life, and health, and peace  
  
**Verse 4**  
He breaks the pow’r of canceled sin  
He sets the pris’ner free  
His blood can make the foulest clean  
His blood availed for me  
  
**Verse 5**  
He speaks, and, list’ning to His voice  
New life the dead receive  
The mournful, broken hearts rejoice  
The humble poor believe  
  
**Verse 6**  
Glory to God, and praise and love  
Be ever, ever giv’n  
By saints below and saints above  
The church in earth and heav’n
