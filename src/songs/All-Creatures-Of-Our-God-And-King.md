# All Creatures of Our God and King

_Francis of Assisi_

**Verse 1**
All creatures of our God and King  
Lift up your voice and with us sing  
Alleluia! Alleluia!  
Thou burning sun with golden beam  
Thou silver moon with softer gleam!  

**Refrain**  
O praise Him! O praise Him!  
Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!

**Verse 2**  
Thou rushing wind that art so strong  
Ye clouds that sail in heavâ€™n along  
O praise Him! Alleluia!  
Thou rising moon, in praise rejoice  
Ye lights of evening, find a voice  

**Verse 3**  
Thou flowing water, pure and clear  
Make music for thy Lord to hear
O praise Him! Alleluia!  
Thou fire so masterful and bright  
That givest man both warmth and light.

**Verse 4** 
And all ye men of tender heart  
Forgiving others, take your part  
O praise Him! Alleluia!  
Ye who long pain and sorrow bear  
Praise God and on Him cast your care!

**Verse 5**  
Let all things their Creator bless  
And worship Him in humbleness  
O praise Him! Alleluia!  
Praise, praise the Father, praise the Son  
And praise the Spirit, Three in One
