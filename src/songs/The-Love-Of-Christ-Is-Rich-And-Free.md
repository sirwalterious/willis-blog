# The Love Of Christ Is Rich And Free  
  
_William Gadsby_  
  
**Verse 1**  
The love of Christ is rich and free  
Fixed on His own eternally  
Nor earth, nor hell, can it remove  
Long as He lives, His own He'll love  
  
**Verse 2**`  
His loving heart engaged to be  
Their everlasting Surety  
'Twas love that took their cause in hand  
And love maintains it to the end  
  
**Chorus**  
Love cannot from its post withdraw  
Nor death, nor hell, nor sin, nor law  
Can turn the Surety's heart away  
He'll love His own to endless day  
  
**Verse 3**  
Love has redeemed His sheep with blood  
And love will bring them safe to God  
Love calls them all from death to life  
And love will finish all their strife  
  
**Verse 4**  
He loves through every changing scene  
Nor aught from Him can Zion wean  
Not all the wanderings of her heart  
Can make His love for her depart  
  
**Verse 5**  
At death, beyond the grave, He'll love  
In endless bliss, His own shall prove  
The blazing glory of that love  
Which never could from them remove
