# Leaning On The Everlasting Arms  
  
_Elisha A. Hoffman_  
  
**Verse 1**  
What a fellowship, what a joy divine  
Leaning on the everlasting arms  
What a blessedness, what a peace is mine  
Leaning on the everlasting arms  
  
**Refrain**  
Leaning, leaning  
Safe and secure from all alarms  
Leaning, leaning  
Leaning on the everlasting arms  
  
**Verse 2**  
Oh, how sweet to walk in this pilgrim way  
Leaning on the everlasting arms  
Oh, how bright the path grows from day to day  
Leaning on the everlasting arms  
  
**Verse 3**  
What have I to dread, what have I to fear  
Leaning on the everlasting arms?  
I have blessed peace with my Lord so near  
Leaning on the everlasting arms
