# Behold Our God

_Jonathan Baird, Meghan Baird, Ryan Baird, and Stephen Altrogge_

**Verse 1**  
Who has held the oceans in His hands?  
Who has numbered every grain of sand?  
Kings and nations tremble at His voice  
All creation rises to rejoice  

**Chorus**  
Behold our God seated on His throne  
Come, let us adore Him  
Behold our King! Nothing can compare  
Come, let us adore Him!

**Verse 2**  
Who has given counsel to the Lord?  
Who can question any of His words?  
Who can teach the One Who knows all things?  
Who can fathom all His wondrous deeds?  

**Verse 3**  
Who has felt the nails upon His hands  
Bearing all the guilt of sinful man?  
God eternal humbled to the grave  
Jesus, Savior risen now to reign!

**Tag**   
Men: You will reign forever  
Women: Let Your glory fill the earth
