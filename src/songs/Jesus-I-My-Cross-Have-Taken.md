# Jesus I My Cross Have Taken  
  
_Henry Lyte_  
  
**Verse 1**  
Jesus, I my cross have taken  
All to leave and follow Thee  
Destitute, despised, forsaken  
Thou from hence my all shall be  
Perish every fond ambition  
All I've sought or hoped or known  
Yet how rich is my condition!  
God and heaven are still my own  
  
**Verse 2**  
Let the world despise and leave me  
They have left my Savior, too  
Human hearts and looks deceive me;  
Thou art not, like them, untrue  
O while Thou dost smile upon me  
God of wisdom, love, and might  
Foes may hate and friends disown me  
Show Thy face and all is bright  
  
**Verse 3**  
Man may trouble and distress me  
Twill but drive me to Thy breast  
Life with trials hard may press me;  
Heaven will bring me sweeter rest  
Oh, 'tis not in grief to harm me  
While Thy love is left to me;  
Oh, 'twere not in joy to charm me  
Were that joy unmixed with Thee  
  
**Verse 4**  
Go, then, earthly fame and treasure  
Come disaster, scorn and pain  
In Thy service, pain is pleasure  
With Thy favor, loss is gain  
I have called Thee Abba Father  
I have stayed my heart on Thee  
Storms may howl, and clouds may gather;  
All must work for good to me  
  
**Verse 5**  
Soul, then know thy full salvation  
Rise o'er sin and fear and care  
Joy to find in every station  
Something still to do or bear  
Think what Spirit dwells within thee  
Think what Fathers smiles are thine  
Think that Jesus died to win thee  
Child of heaven, canst thou repine  
  
**Verse 6**  
Haste thee on from grace to glory  
Armed by faith, and winged by prayer  
Heavens eternal days before thee  
Gods own hand shall guide us there  
Soon shall close thy earthly mission  
Soon shall pass thy pilgrim days  
Hope shall change to glad fruition  
Faith to sight, and prayer to praise
