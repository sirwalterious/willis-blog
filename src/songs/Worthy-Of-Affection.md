# Worthy Of Affection  
  
_Shane and Shane_  
  
**Verse 1**  
Deliver you brought us out of the miry clay  
You set our feet upon the rock  
And You made us sing, holy is the Lord  
If You would declare Your thoughts about us  
One by one it would be too many to count  
So we simply come to sing of your great love  
So we sing, we lift our hands and sing  
  
**Chorus**  
You are worthy of affection  
You're the radiance of all of His glory  
Let our adoration fill this place  
You hold everything together  
By the word of your immovable power  
We sing this song of praise  
  
**Verse 2**  
We are the broken down  
And we are the beaten up  
But what can stop us  
From the song of unending love, Holy is the Lord  
You are the treasure  
The hope, the bright and morning star  
You are the lover of our soul  
And you won our hearts we sing of Your great love  
So we sing we lift our hands and sing  
  
**Bridge**  
Holy are You Lord  (repeat)
