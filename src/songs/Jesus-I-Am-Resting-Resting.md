# Jesus I Am Resting, Resting  
  
_Jean S. Pigott_  
  
**Verse 1**  
Jesus, I am resting, resting  
In the joy of what Thou art  
I am finding out the greatness  
Of Thy loving heart  
Thou hast bid me gaze upon Thee  
And Thy beauty fills my soul  
For by Thy transforming power  
Thou hast made me whole  
  
**Refrain**  
Jesus, I am resting, resting  
In the joy of what Thou art  
I am finding out the greatness  
Of Thy loving heart  
  
**Verse 2**  
Oh, how great Thy loving kindness  
Vaster, broader than the sea  
Oh, how marvelous Thy goodness  
Lavished all on me  
Yes, I rest in Thee, Beloved  
Know what wealth of grace is Thine  
Know Thy certainty of promise  
And have made it mine  
  
**Verse 3**  
Simply trusting Thee, Lord Jesus  
I behold Thee as Thou art  
And Thy love, so pure, so changeless  
Satisfies my heart  
Satisfies its deepest longings  
Meets, supplies its every need  
Compasseth me round with blessings  
Thine is love indeed  
  
**Verse 4**  
Ever lift Thy face upon me  
As I work and wait for Thee  
Resting ’neath Thy smile, Lord Jesus  
Earth’s dark shadows flee  
Brightness of my Father’s glory  
Sunshine of my Father’s face  
Keep me ever trusting, resting,  
Fill me with Thy grace
