# All You Are

_Ben Zornes_

**Verse 1**  
Oh to know You, and make You known  
You've purchased my life and I am not my own  
Making much of You with everything in me  
and every breath I breathe is a tribute to Your mercy  

**Chorus**  
And all You are is all I ever want to know  
Your voice breathed out the stars and set the sun aglow    
You're the God of grace and love and light    
The King who reigns with endless might  
Though some refuse to bow, my heart cannot find how  
A soul cannot delight in all You are 

**Verse 2**  
You shall ever be my only joy  
You're the love of my life and the aim of my heart  
Though this simple song is foolish to the world  
I can't refuse to sing all the glory of my King  

**Bridge**  
All You are, You have always been  
All You are, You are right now  
All You are, You shall ever be  
All I need is all You are
