# Ancient Of Days

_Ron Kenoly_

**Verse 1**  
Blessing and honor, glory and power  
Be unto the Ancient of Days  
From every nation, all of creation  
Bow before the Ancient of Days  

**Chorus**  
Every tongue in heaven and earth shall declare Your glory  
Every knee shall bow at Your throne in worship  
You will be exalted, oh God  
And Your kingdom shall not pass away  
Oh, Ancient of Days
