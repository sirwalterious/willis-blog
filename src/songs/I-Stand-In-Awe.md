# I Stand In Awe
  
_Mark Altrogge_  
  
**Verse 1**  
You are beautiful beyond description  
Too marvelous for words  
Too wonderful for comprehension  
Like nothing ever seen or heard  
Who can grasp Your infinite wisdom?  
Who can fathom the depth of Your love?  
You are beautiful beyond description  
Majesty, enthroned above  
  
**Chorus**  
And I stand, I stand in awe of You  
I stand, I stand in awe of You  
Holy God, to whom all praise is due  
I stand in awe of You  
  
**Verse 2**  
You are beautiful beyond description  
Yet God crushed You for my sin  
In agony and deep affliction  
Cut off that I might enter in  
Who can grasp such tender compassion?  
Who can fathom this mercy so free?  
You are beautiful beyond description  
Lamb of God who died for me
