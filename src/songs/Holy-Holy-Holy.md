# Holy, Holy, Holy

_Reginald Heber_

**Verse 1**  
Holy, holy, holy! Lord God Almighty  
Early in the morning our song shall rise to Thee  
Holy, holy, holy, merciful and mighty  
God in three Persons, blessed Trinity  

**Verse 2**  
Holy, holy, holy! All the saints adore Thee  
Casting down their golden crowns around the glassy sea  
Cherubim and seraphim falling down before Thee  
Who was, and is, and evermore shall be  

**Verse 3**  
Holy, holy, holy! Though the darkness hide Thee  
Though the eye of sinful man Thy glory may not see  
Only Thou art holy; there is none beside Thee  
Perfect in powâ€™r, in love, and purity  

**Verse 4**  
Holy, holy, holy! Lord God Almighty  
All Thy works shall praise Thy Name, in earth, and sky, and sea  
Holy, holy, holy; merciful and mighty  
God in three Persons, blessed Trinity
