# His Lovingkindness

_Ben Zornes_

**Verse 1**  
Awake, my soul, in joy filled grace, and sing thy great Redeemer's praise  
He justly claims a song from me; His lovingkindness, O how free  
He saw me ruined in the fall, yet loved me notwithstanding all  
He saved me from my lost estate; His lovingkindness, O... how great  

**Verse 2**  
Through numerous hosts of mighty foes, though earth and hell my way oppose  
He safely leads my soul along; His lovingkindness, O how strong  
When trouble like a gloomy cloud, has gathered thick and thundered loud  
He near my soul has always stood; His lovingkindness, O... how good  

**Chorus**  
His lovingkindness, His lovingkindness  
How measureless and O how sweet  
His lovingkindness, His lovingkindness  
How measureless and O...  how sweet  

**Verse 3**  
Often I feel my sinful heart prone from my Savior to depart  
But though I have him oft forgot, His lovingkindness changes not  
Soon shall I pass the gloomy vale; soon all my mortal powers must fail  
O may my last expiring breath His lovingkindness sing... in death  

**Tag**  
Then let me mount and soar away to the bright world of endless day  
And sing with rapture and surprise, His lovingkindness in... the skies
