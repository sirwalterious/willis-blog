# To God Be The Glory  
  
_Frances J. Crosby_  
  
**Verse 1**  
To God be the glory, great things He hath done  
So loved He the world that He gave us His Son  
Who yielded His life an atonement for sin  
And opened the life gate that all may go in  
  
**Refrain**  
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, let the earth hear His voice!  
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, let the people rejoice!  
Oh, come to the Father, through Jesus the Son  
And give Him the glory, great things He hath done  
  
**Verse 2**  
Oh, perfect redemption, the purchase of blood  
To every believer the promise of God  
The vilest offender who truly believes  
That moment from Jesus a pardon receives  
  
**Verse 3**  
Great things He hath taught us, great things He hath done  
And great our rejoicing through Jesus the Son  
But purer, and higher, and greater will be  
Our wonder, our transport, when Jesus we see
