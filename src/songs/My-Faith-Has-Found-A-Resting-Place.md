# My Faith Has Found A Resting Place    
    
_Eliza E. Hewitt_    
  
**Verse 1**  
My faith has found a resting place  
Not in device or creed  
I trust the ever-living One  
His wounds for me shall plead  
  
**Refrain**  
I need no other argument  
I need no other plea  
It is enough that Jesus died  
And that He died for me  
  
**Verse 2**  
Enough for me that Jesus saves  
This ends my fear and doubt  
A sinful soul I came to Him  
He’ll never cast me out  
  
**Verse 3**  
My heart is leaning on the Word  
The living Word of God  
Salvation by my Savior’s name  
Salvation through His blood  
  
**Verse 4**  
My great physician heals the sick  
The lost He came to save  
For me His precious blood He shed  
For me His life He gave
