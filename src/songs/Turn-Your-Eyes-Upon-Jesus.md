# Turn Your Eyes Upon Jesus  
  
_Helen H. Lemmel_  
  
**Verse 1**  
O soul, are you weary and troubled?  
No light in the darkness you see?  
There’s light for a look at the Savior  
And life more abundant and free!  
  
**Refrain**  
Turn your eyes upon Jesus  
Look full in His wonderful face  
And the things of earth will grow strangely dim  
In the light of His glory and grace  
  
**Verse 2**  
Through death into life everlasting  
He passed, and we follow Him there  
O’er us sin no more hath dominion  
For more than conqu’rors we are!  
  
**Verse 3**  
His Word shall not fail you — He promised  
Believe Him, and all will be well  
Then go to a world that is dying  
His perfect salvation to tell!
