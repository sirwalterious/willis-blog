# For The Glory Of God

_Walter Willis_

**Verse 1**  
Your love surrounds me with endless mercies  
O how Your grace abounds!  
How can I repay the holy King of Kings?  
Let my life be an offering

**Chorus**  
For the glory of God  
For the glory of God  
Every word every breath  
Every step of the way  
I give it all for the glory of God

**Verse 2**  
Now one purpose, Now one aim  
Lift high the name of Jesus Christ  
More of You, less of me  
Let my anthem always be  

**Tag**  
To You be glory  
To You be honor  
To You be glory forever
