# You Are My All In All  
  
_Dennis L. Jernigan_  
  
**Verse 1**  
You are my strength when I am weak  
You are the treasure that I seek  
You are my all in all  
Seeking You as a precious jewel  
Lord, to give up I'd be a fool  
You are my all in all  
  
**Chorus**  
Jesus, Lamb of God  
Worthy is Your name  
Jesus, Lamb of God  
Worthy is Your name  
  
**Verse 2**  
Taking my sin, my cross, my shame  
Rising up again I bless Your name  
You are my all in all  
When I fall down You pick me up  
When I am dry You fill my cup  
You are my all in all
