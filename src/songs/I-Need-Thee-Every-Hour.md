# I Need Thee Every Hour 

_Annie S. Hawks_

**Verse 1**  
I need Thee every hour, most gracious Lord  
No tender voice like Thine can peace afford 

**Refrain**  
I need Thee, oh, I need Thee  
Every hour I need Thee  
Oh, bless me now, my Savior  
I come to Thee 

**Verse 2**  
I need Thee every hour, stay Thou nearby  
Temptations lose their powâ€™r when Thou art nigh  

**Verse 3**  
I need Thee every hour, in joy or pain  
Come quickly and abide, or life is vain  

**Verse 4**  
I need Thee every hour; teach me Thy will  
And Thy rich promises in me fulfill

**Verse 5**  
I need Thee every hour, most Holy One  
Oh, make me Thine indeed, Thou blessed Son
