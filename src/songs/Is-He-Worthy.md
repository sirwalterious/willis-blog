# Is He Worthy?  
  
_Andrew Peterson_  
  
**Verse 1**  
Do you feel the world is broken? (We do)  
Do you feel the shadows deepen? (We do)  
But do you know that all the dark won't stop the light from getting through? (We do)  
Do you wish that you could see it all made new? (We do)  
  
**Verse 2**  
Is all creation groaning? (It is)  
Is a new creation coming? (It is)  
Is the glory of the Lord to be the light within our midst? (It is)  
Is it good that we remind ourselves of this? (It is)  
  
**Chorus**  
Is anyone worthy? Is anyone whole?  
Is anyone able to break the seal and open the scroll?  
The Lion of Judah who conquered the grave  
He is David's root and the Lamb who died to ransom the slave  
Is He worthy? Is He worthy?  
Of all blessing and honor and glory  
Is He worthy of this?  
He is  
  
**Verse 3**  
Does the Father truly love us? (He does)  
Does the Spirit move among us? (He does)  
And does Jesus, our Messiah hold forever those He loves? (He does)  
Does our God intend to dwell again with us? (He does)  
  
**Chorus 2**  
Is anyone worthy? Is anyone whole?  
Is anyone able to break the seal and open the scroll?  
The Lion of Judah who conquered the grave  
He is David's root and the Lamb who died to ransom the slave  
From every people and tribe, every nation and tongue  
He has made us a kingdom and priests to God to reign with the Son  
Is He worthy? Is He worthy?  
Of all blessing and honor and glory  
Is He worthy? Is He worthy?  
Is He worthy of this?  
He is!
