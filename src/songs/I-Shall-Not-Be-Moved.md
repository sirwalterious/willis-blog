# I Shall Not Be Moved  
  
_Ben Zornes_  
  
**Verse 1**    
You lifted me out of the pit, and saved me from my plight    
And with Your glorious power you seat me with Christ on high    
Now the sun can not harm me by day, nor the moon by night    
You train my hands for war, and fill me with Your might    
The gates of hell cannot prevail   
And neither You nor Your promise can fail  
  
**Chorus**  
Because You are my rock and my salvation  
You are the only sure foundation  
I shall not be moved,  I will not fear  
For You are near, and I shall not be moved  
  
**Verse 2**  
Though foes of all kind seek to steal, kill, hate and destroy  
I will not fear their contempt for You stay me with Your joy  
You gird me with strength and with courage which none can alloy  
O Jesus You are unto me a shield against Satan’s ploys  
I know that hell will not prevail and neither You nor Your promise can fail  
  
**Bridge**  
I will love Thee oh Lord my strength  
My song in the night, my fortress, my light  
My Lord forever lives and is rock beneath my feet  
And let God alone be evermore exalted  
  
**Tag**    
I shall not be, I shall not be moved    
Stayed upon Jehovah, I shall not be moved    
Just like a tree, that’s planted by the water    
I shall not be moved
