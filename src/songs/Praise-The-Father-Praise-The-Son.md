# Praise The Father, Praise The Son  
  
_Chris Tomlin_  
  
**Verse 1**  
Oh sovereign God, oh matchless King  
The saints adore, the angels sing  
And fall before the throne on grace  
To you belongs the highest praise  
  
**Verse 2**  
These sufferings, this passing tide  
Under Your wings I will abide  
And every enemy shall flee  
You are my hope and victory  
  
**Chorus**  
Praise the Father, praise the Son  
Praise the Spirit, three in One  
Clothed in power and in grace  
The name above all other names  
  
**Verse 3**  
To the valley, for my soul  
Thy great descent has made me whole  
You word my heart has welcomed home  
Now peace like water ever flows  
  
**Bridge**  
Yours is the kingdom  
Yours is the power  
Your is the glory forever  
Yours is the kingdom  
Yours is the power  
Your is the glory forever
