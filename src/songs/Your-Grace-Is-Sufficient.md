# Your Grace Is Sufficient  
  
_Shane and Shane_  
  
**Verse 1**  
Your grace is sufficient for me  
Your strength is made perfect  
When I am weak  
And all that I cling to  
I lay at Your feet  
Your grace is sufficient for me  
  
**Chorus**  
To see the Lord - the Promised Land  
Wherein all sin's pearly gates look bland   
And what was once a pearl, is now sand  
That blows away, that blows away  
In light of Him
