# Beneath The Cross Of Jesus

_Elizabeth Cecilia Clephane_

**Verse 1**  
Beneath the cross of Jesus I fain would take my stand  
The shadow of a mighty Rock within a weary land  
A home within the wilderness, a rest upon the way  
From the burning of the noontide heat and the burden of the day  

**Verse 2**  
Oh, safe and happy shelter, Oh, refuge tried and sweet  
Oh, trysting place where heaven’s love and heaven’s justice meet  
As to the holy patriarch that wondrous dream was given  
So is my Savior by the cross a ladder up to heaven  

**Verse 3**  
There lies beneath its shadow, But on the farther side  
The darkness of an awful grave that gapes both deep and wide  
And there between us stands the cross, two arms outstretched to save   
Like a watchman set to guard the way from that eternal grave  

**Verse 4**  
Upon that cross of Jesus mine eye at times can see  
The very dying form of One, Who suffered there for me  
And from my smitten heart, with tears, two wonders I confess  
The wonders of His glorious love, and my own worthlessness  

**Verse 5**  
I take, O cross, thy shadow for my abiding place  
I ask no other sunshine than the sunshine of His face  
Content to let the world go by, to know no gain nor loss  
My sinful self my only shame, my glory all the cross
