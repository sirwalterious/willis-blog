# We Rest On Thee    
    
_Edith G. Cherry_    
    
**Verse 1**    
We rest on Thee, our Shield and our Defender!  
We go not forth alone against the foe  
Strong in Thy strength, safe in Thy keeping tender  
We rest on Thee, and in Thy Name we go  
  
**Verse 2**  
Yes, in Thy Name, O Captain of salvation!  
In Thy dear Name, all other names above  
Jesus our Righteousness, our sure Foundation  
Our Prince of glory and our King of love  
  
**Verse 3**  
We go in faith, our own great weakness feeling  
And needing more each day Thy grace to know  
Yet from our hearts a song of triumph pealing  
“We rest on Thee, and in Thy Name we go.”  
  
**Verse 4**  
We rest on Thee, our Shield and our Defender!  
Thine is the battle, Thine shall be the praise  
When passing through the gates of pearly splendor  
Victors, we rest with Thee, through endless days
