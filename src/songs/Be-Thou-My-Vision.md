# Be Thou My Vision

_Dallan Forgaill_

**Verse 1**  
Be Thou my Vision, O Lord of my heart  
Naught be all else to me, save that Thou art  
Thou my best Thought, by day or by night  
Waking or sleeping, Thy presence my light  

**Verse 2**  
Be Thou my Wisdom, and Thou my true Word  
I ever with Thee and Thou with me, Lord  
Thou my great Father, I Thy true son  
Thou in me dwelling, and I with Thee one  

**Verse 3**  
Be Thou my battle Shield, Sword for the fight  
Be Thou my Dignity, Thou my Delight  
Thou my soul’s Shelter, Thou my high Tow’r  
Raise Thou me heav’nward, O Pow’r of my pow’r  

**Verse 4**  
Riches I heed not, nor man’s empty praise  
Thou mine Inheritance, now and always  
Thou and Thou only, first in my heart  
High King of Heaven, my Treasure Thou art  

**Verse 5**  
High King of Heaven, my victory won   
May I reach Heaven’s joys, O bright Heav’n’s Sun  
Heart of my own heart, whatever befall  
Still be my Vision, O Ruler of all
