# Rock Of Ages    
    
_Augustus M. Toplady_    
  
**Verse 1**  
Rock of Ages, cleft for me  
Let me hide myself in Thee  
Let the water and the blood  
From Thy wounded side which flowed  
Be of sin the double cure  
Save from wrath and make me pure  
  
**Verse 2**  
Not the labor of my hands  
Can fulfill Thy lawâ€™s demands  
Could my zeal no respite know  
Could my tears forever flow  
All for sin could not atone  
Thou must save, and Thou alone  
  
**Verse 3**  
Nothing in my hand I bring  
Simply to Thy cross I cling  
Naked, come to Thee for dress  
Helpless, look to Thee for grace  
Foul, I to the fountain fly  
Wash me, Savior, or I die  
  
**Verse 4**  
While I draw this fleeting breath  
When my eyes shall close in death  
When I rise to worlds unknown  
And behold Thee on Thy throne  
Rock of Ages, cleft for me  
Let me hide myself in Thee
