# Fairest Lord Jesus

_Anonymous_

**Verse 1**  
Fairest Lord Jesus, Ruler of all nature  
O Thou of God and man the Son  
Thee will I cherish, Thee will I honor  
Thou, my soul’s glory, joy and crown  

**Verse 2**  
Fair are the meadows, fairer still the woodlands  
Robed in the blooming garb of spring  
Jesus is fairer, Jesus is purer  
Who makes the woeful heart to sing.  

**Verse 3**  
Fair is the sunshine, fairer still the moonlight  
And all the twinkling starry host  
Jesus shines brighter, Jesus shines purer  
Than all the angels heav’n can boast  

**Verse 4**  
All fairest beauty, heavenly and earthly  
Wondrously, Jesus, is found in Thee  
None can be nearer, fairer or dearer  
Than Thou, my Savior, art to me

**Verse 5**  
Beautiful Savior! Lord of all the nations  
Son of God and Son of Man  
Glory and honor, praise, adoration  
Now and forevermore be Thine.
