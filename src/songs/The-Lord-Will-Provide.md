# The Lord Will Provide  
  
_John Newton_  
  
**Verse 1**  
Though troubles assail and dangers affright  
Though friends should all fail and foes all unite  
Yet one thing secures us, whatever betide  
The scripture assures us, the Lord will provide  
The birds without barn or storehouse are fed  
From them let us learn to trust for our bread:  
His saints, what is fitting, shall ne'er be denied  
So long as it's written, the Lord will provide  
  
**Verse 2**  
We may, like the ships, by tempest be tossed  
On perilous deeps, but cannot be lost  
Though Satan enrages the wind and the tide  
The promise engages, the Lord will provide  
His call we obey, like Abram of old  
Not knowing our way, but faith makes us bold  
For though we are strangers we have a good Guide  
And trust in all dangers, the Lord will provide  
  
**Verse 3**  
When Satan appears to stop up our path  
And fill us with fears, we triumph by faith  
He cannot take from us, though oft he has tried  
This heart-cheering promise, the Lord will provide  
He tells us we're weak, our hope is in vain  
The good that we seek we ne'er shall obtain  
But when such suggestions our spirits have plied  
This answers all questions, the Lord will provide  
  
**Verse 4**  
No strength of our own, or goodness we claim  
Yet since we have known the Savior's great name  
In this our strong tower for safety we hide  
The Lord is our power, the Lord will provide  
When life sinks apace and death is in view  
This word of his grace shall comfort us through:  
No fearing or doubting with Christ on our side  
We hope to die shouting "the Lord will provide"
