# Evermore

_Ben Zornes_

**Verse 1**  
In every valley I’ve been through  
In every joy and trouble too  
No matter my condition or circumstance   
You remain forever sure and steadfast  
Through all my future, present and past  

**Verse 2**  
Through all the windings of my way  
For the burden of living this day  
And for all the trials and triumphs of tomorrow  
I can trust the Keeper of the sparrow  
To uphold me in gladness, grief, and sorrow.

**Chorus**  
You were faithful before I ever drew a breath  
You are faithful at present, Oh Lord  
And I know even after earth’s final day  
God You’ll be, faithful evermore

**Verse 3**  
Though I can’t see far ahead  
I will rest in what Your Word has said  
That faithful is He who has called me  
And what He’s begun He’s faithful to complete  
So from here on out onward is my creed 

**Tag**  
When death will be swallowed in victory  
And my tears will be swept into the sea  
And I’ll see how you led me so faithfully  
And still you’ll be, faithful evermore…
