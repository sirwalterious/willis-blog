# Jesus Messiah  
  
_Chris Tomlin_  
  
**Verse 1**  
He became sin, who knew no sin  
That we might become his righteousness  
He humbled himself and carried the cross  
Love so amazing, love so amazing  
  
**Chorus**  
Jesus messiah, name above all names  
Blessed redeemer, Emmanuel  
The rescue for sinners, the ransom from heaven  
Jesus messiah, lord of all  
  
**Verse 2**  
His body the bread, his blood the wine  
Broken and poured out all for love  
The whole earth trembled, and the veil was torn  
Love so amazing, how can it be? Your love's so amazing, yeah  
  
**Bridge**  
All our hope is in you, all our hope is in you  
All the glory to you, God, the light of the world
