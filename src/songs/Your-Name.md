# Your Name  
  
_Paul Baloche_  
  
**Verse 1**  
As morning dawns and evening fades  
You inspire songs of praise  
That rise from earth to touch Your heart  
And glorify Your Name  
  
**Chorus**  
Your Name is a strong and mighty tower  
Your Name is a shelter like no other  
Your Name, let the nations sing it louder  
'Cause nothing has the power to save  
But Your Name  
  
**Verse 2**  
Jesus, in Your Name we pray  
Come and fill our hearts today  
Lord, give us strength to live for You  
And glorify Your Name
