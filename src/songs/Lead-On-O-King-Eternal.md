# Lead On O King Eternal  
  
_Ernest W. Shurtleff, Ben Zornes_  
  
**Verse 1**  
Lead on, O King Eternal  
The day of march has come  
Henceforth in fields of conquest  
Thy tents shall be our home  
Through days of preparation  
Thy grace has made us strong  
And now, O King Eternal  
We lift our battle song  
  
**Verse 2**  
Lead on, O King Eternal  
Till sin’s fierce war shall cease  
And holiness shall whisper  
The sweet amen of peace  
For not with swords’ loud clashing  
Nor roll of stirring drums  
With deeds of love and mercy  
The heav’nly kingdom comes  
  
**Chorus**  
Lead on, O King  
Lead on, O King  
Lead on, O King, lead on  
  
**Verse 3**  
Lead on, O King Eternal  
We follow, not with fears  
For gladness breaks like morning  
Where’er Thy face appears  
Thy cross is lifted o’er us  
We journey in its light  
The crown awaits the conquest  
Lead on, O God of might
