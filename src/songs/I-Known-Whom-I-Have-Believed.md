# I Know Whom I Have Believed

_Daniel W. Whittle_

**Verse 1**  
I know not why God’s wondrous grace  
To me He hath made known  
Nor why, unworthy, Christ in love  
Redeemed me for His own  

**Refrain**  
But I know Whom I have believed  
And am persuaded that He is able  
To keep that which I’ve committed  
Unto Him against that day 

**Verse 2**  
I know not how this saving faith  
To me He did impart  
Nor how believing in His Word  
Wrought peace within my heart  

**Verse 3**  
I know not how the Spirit moves  
Convincing men of sin  
Revealing Jesus through the Word  
Creating faith in Him

**Verse 4**  
I know not what of good or ill  
May be reserved for me  
Of weary ways or golden days  
Before His face I see

**Verse 5**  
I know not when my Lord may come  
At night or noonday fair  
Nor if I walk the vale with Him  
Or meet Him in the air
