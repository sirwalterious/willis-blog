# Glory To God Forever

_Steve Fee_

**Verse 1**  
Before the world was made, before You spoke it to be  
You were the King of kings, yeah You were, yeah You were  
And now You're reigning still, enthroned above all things  
Angels and saints cry out, we join them as we sing  

**Chorus**  
Glory to God, glory to God  
Glory to God, forever  
Glory to God, glory to God  
Glory to God, forever, yeah  

**Verse 2**  
Creator God, You gave me breath so I could praise  
Your great and matchless name, all my days, all my days  
So let my whole life be a blazing offering  
A life that shouts and sings the greatness of our King  

**Bridge**  
Take my life and let it be  
All for You and for Your glory  
Take my life and let it be yours
