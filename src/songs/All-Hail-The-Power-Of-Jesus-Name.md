# All Hail The Power of Jesus' Name

_Edward Perronet_

**Verse 1**  
All hail the pow’r of Jesus’ Name  
Let angels prostrate fall  
Bring forth the royal diadem  
And crown Him Lord of all

**Verse 2**  
Ye chosen seed of Israel’s race  
Ye ransomed from the fall  
Hail Him Who saves you by His grace  
And crown Him Lord of all  

**Verse 3**  
Let every kindred, every tribe  
On this terrestrial ball  
To Him all majesty ascribe  
And crown Him Lord of all  

**Verse 4**  
Oh, that with yonder sacred throng  
We at His feet may fall  
We’ll join the everlasting song  
And crown Him Lord of all
