# Majesty Of Heaven  
  
_Chris Tomlin_  
  
**Verse 1**  
Majesty of Heaven, Your glory fills the skies  
Light of the world, You are Lord of all  
  
**Verse 2**  
Humbled by Your presence, amazed by who Your are  
Nothing compares, You are Lord of all  
  
**Chorus**  
To You the nations bow down  
To You creation cries out, Majesty  
All things You hold together  
You're name will stand forever, Majesty  
You are Majesty  
  
**Verse 3**  
Merciful and mighty, my heart is overwhelmed  
You stand alone, You are Lord of all  
  
**Bridge**  
Your name above all others  
High and exalted  
Your kingdom shall reign forever  
High and exalted
