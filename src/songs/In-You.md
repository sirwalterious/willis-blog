# In You

_Ben Zornes_

**Verse 1**  
The ocean depths of Your righteousness  
Are a hiding place where our souls find rest  
From the endless toil of a selfish life  
And the promise of being found in Christ  
For Your flawless Word stands sure and fast
And all You’ve said will come to pass  
So we confess with joy the precious Gospel truth  
And sing our only hope is found in You

**Pre-Chorus**  
By grace I now believe, by faith I now receive  
The treasure of life in You  

**Chorus**  
In You the old has gone, in You new life has come  
What else could I plead, where else can I go  
There’s no other fount I know  
so, I hide myself in You

**Verse 2**  
Time and words both fail to express  
The fullness of Your matchless loveliness  
So I fall to my knees to kiss Your nail scarred feet  
And gladly believe the glorious Gospel of peace  
I now reckon it true that being found in You   
Your cross was mine and now I’m made new  
So I present my life forever yield my all  
to the King of king’s loving beck and call

**Bridge**  
It’s a beautiful refrain the covenant of grace  
Thy life for mine, my life for thine
