# Soon  
  
_Brooke Ligertwood_  
  
**Verse 1**  
Soon and very soon my King is coming  
Robed in righteousness and crowned with love  
When I see Him I shall be made like Him  
Soon and very soon  
  
**Chorus**  
I will be with the One I love  
With unveiled face I'll see Him  
There my soul will be satisfied  
Soon and very soon  
  
**Verse 2**  
Soon and very soon see the procession  
The angels and the elders 'round the throne  
At His feet I'll lay my crowns my worship  
Soon and very soon  
  
**Bridge**  
Though I have not seen Him  
My heart knows Him well  
Jesus Christ the Lamb  
The Lord of heaven
