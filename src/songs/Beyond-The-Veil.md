# Beyond The Veil

_Walter Willis_

**Verse 1**  
O my soul, look beyond the clouds  
Set your gaze on eternity  
Temporal pains and pleasures melt away like snow  
At brilliance beyond the galaxies  

**Verse 2**  
I’m desperate for a glimpse beyond the veil  
Just a glimpse of reality  
A living scene that stands, ‘cross the folds of time  
Guide my eyes to see  

**Chorus**  
See the lamb, lifted high  
Let his name be magnified  
All things lay at his feet  
Ultimate, majesty  
In the light of His face worldly things grow pale  
Just a glimpse beyond the veil  

**Verse 3**  
O my soul, live beyond this life  
The blood was shed to ransom thee  
Christ is coming soon to gather all His bride  
and on that day we’ll see

**Bridge**  
Just a few more days  
Just a few more years  
By His grace we’ll persevere

**Final Chorus**  
See the bride, ‘dorned in white  
Radiant in His sight  
All the trials upon her brow  
Have turned into a glorious crown  
We will see face to face, and human words will fail  
More than a glimpse beyond the veil   
And we will be beyond the veil  
Forevermore beyond the veil
