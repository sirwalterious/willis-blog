# Man Of Sorrows (Contemporary)  
  
_Matthew Crocker, Brooke Ligertwood_  
  
**Verse 1**  
Man of sorrows, Lamb of God, by His own betrayed  
The sin of man and wrath of God, has been on Jesus laid  
  
**Verse 2**  
Silent as He stood accused, beaten, mocked, and scorned  
Bowing to the Father's will, He took a crown of thorns  
  
**Chorus**  
Oh that rugged cross my salvation  
Where Your love poured out over me  
Now my soul cries out hallelujah  
Praise and honour unto Thee  
  
**Verse 3**  
Sent of heaven God's own Son, to purchase and redeem  
And reconcile the very ones, who nailed Him to that tree  
  
**Bridge**  
Now my debt is paid, it is paid in full  
By the precious blood that my Jesus spilled  
Now the curse of sin has no hold on me  
Whom the Son sets free Oh is free indeed  
  
**Verse 4**  
See the stone is rolled away, behold the empty tomb  
Hallelujah, God be praised, He's risen from the grave
