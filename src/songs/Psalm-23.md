# Psalm 23  
  
_Shane and Shane_  
  
**Verse 1**  
The Lord is my Shepherd I shall not want  
In green pastures He makes me lie down  
He restores my soul and leads me on for His Name  
For His great Name  
  
**Chorus**  
Surely goodness surely mercy  
Right beside me all my days  
And I will dwell in Your house forever  
And bless Your Holy Name  
  
**Verse 2**  
You prepare a table right before me  
In the presence of my enemies  
Though the arrow flies and the terror of night  
Is at my door I'll trust you Lord  
  
**Bridge**  
Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death  
I will fear no evil  
Even though I walk through the valley  
of the shadow of death  
You are on my side
