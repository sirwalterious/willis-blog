# Everlasting God

_Brenton Brown, Ken Riley_

**Verse 1**  
Strength will rise as we wait upon the Lord  
Wait upon the Lord, we will wait upon the Lord  
Strength will rise as we wait upon the Lord  
Wait upon the Lord, we will wait upon the Lord  
Our God, You reign forever  
Our hope, our strong deliverer  

**Chorus**  
You are the everlasting God  
The everlasting God  
You do not faint, you won't grow weary  
You're the defender of the weak  
You comfort those in need  
You lift us up on wings like eagles
