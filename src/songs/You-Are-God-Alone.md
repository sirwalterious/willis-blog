# You Are God Alone  
  
_Billy Foote, Cindy Foote_  
  
**Verse 1**  
You are not a God, created by human hands  
You are not a God, dependent on any mortal man  
You are not a God, in need of anything we can give  
By Your plan, that's just the way it is  
  
**Chorus**  
You are God alone, from before time began  
You were on Your throne  
You are God alone  
And right now, in the good times and bad  
You are on Your throne  
And you are God alone  
  
**Verse 2**  
You're the only God whose power none can contend  
You're the only God whose name and praise will never end  
You're the only God who's worthy of everything we can give  
You are God and that's just the way it is  
  
**Bridge**  
Unchangeable, unshakable, unstoppable  
That's what You are  
Unchangeable, unshakable, unstoppable  
That's what You are
