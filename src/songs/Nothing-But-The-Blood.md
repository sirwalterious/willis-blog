# Nothing But The Blood  
  
_Robert Lowry_  
  
**Verse 1**  
What can wash away my sin? Nothing but the blood of Jesus  
What can make me whole again? Nothing but the blood of Jesus  
  
**Refrain**  
Oh! precious is the flow  
That makes me white as snow  
No other fount I know  
Nothing but the blood of Jesus  
  
**Verse 2**  
For my pardon, this I see, nothing but the blood of Jesus  
For my cleansing this my plea, nothing but the blood of Jesus  
  
**Verse 3**  
Nothing can for sin atone, nothing but the blood of Jesus  
Naught of good that I have done, nothing but the blood of Jesus  
  
**Verse 4**  
This is all my hope and peace, nothing but the blood of Jesus  
This is all my righteousness, nothing but the blood of Jesus  
  
**Verse 5**  
Now by this I’ll overcome— Nothing but the blood of Jesus  
Now by this I’ll reach my home— Nothing but the blood of Jesus  
  
**Verse 6**  
Glory! Glory! This I sing— Nothing but the blood of Jesus  
All my praise for this I bring— Nothing but the blood of Jesus
