# Christ Is Risen

_Matt Maher_

**Verse 1**  
Let no one caught in sin remain  
Inside the lie of inward shame  
We fix our eyes upon the cross  
And run to Him who showed great love  
And bled for us, freely You've bled for us

**Chorus**  
Christ is risen from the dead  
Trampling over death by death  
Come awake, come awake  
Come and rise up from the grave  
Christ is risen from the dead  
We are one with Him again  
Come awake, come awake  
Come and rise up from the grave  

**Verse 2**  
Beneath the weight of all our sin  
You bowed to none but Heaven's will  
No scheme of Hell, no scoffer's crown  
No burden great can hold You down  
In strength You reign  
Forever let Your church proclaim  

**Bridge** 
O death, where is your sting?  
O hell, where is your victory?  
O church, come stand in the light  
The glory of God has defeated the night  
Sing it, o death, where is your sting?
O hell, where is your victory?
O church, come stand in the light
Our God is not dead, He's alive, He's alive
