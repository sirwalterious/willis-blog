# Calvary's Law

_Ben Zornes_

**Verse 1**  
While Sinai’s law was great indeed  
And showed to me my soul’s great need  
There, crimson, shines a mount of awe  
And freedom’s found in Calv’ry’s Law  
Yes freedom’s found in Calv’ry’s Law

**Verse 2**  
On Calv’ry’s Law and it alone  
I place my confidence and hope  
That though a sinner I am saved  
not by my goodness but by grace  
oh not by goodness but by grace  

**Refrain**  
Sing oh sing, ye host of Heav’n  
Grace is not earned it’s freely giv’n  
Oh how great the debt I owed  
But greater far the price He paid  
It’s grace alone by which I’m saved

**Verse 3**  
In light of God’s great righteousness  
How dark my guilt and arrogance  
With no excuse with which to plead  
By faith I flee to hide in Thee  
By faith I flee to hide in Thee  

**Verse 4**  
Oh Calvary’s Law is simply this  
Cast doubt aside, and cling to grace  
Trust not the good of thy own hand  
And rest thy faith in the Son of Man  
I rest my faith in Calv’ry’s Lamb
