# I Stand Amazed  
  
_Charles Hutchinson Gabriel_  
  
**Verse 1**  
I stand amazed in the presence  
Of Jesus the Nazarene,  
And wonder how He could love me,  
A sinner condemned, unclean.  
  
**Refrain**  
How marvelous! How wonderful!  
And my song shall ever be:  
How marvelous! How wonderful!  
Is my Savior’s love for me!  
  
**Verse 2**  
For me it was in the garden,  
He prayed: “Not my will, but Thine.”  
He had no tears for His own griefs,  
But sweat-drops of blood for mine.  
  
**Verse 3**  
He took my sins and my sorrows,  
He made them His very own;  
He bore the burden to Calv’ry,  
And suffered, and died alone.  
  
**Verse 4**  
When with the ransomed in glory  
His face I at last shall see,  
’Twill be my joy through the ages  
To sing of His love for me.
