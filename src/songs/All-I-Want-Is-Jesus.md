# All I Want Is Jesus

_Ben Zornes_

**Verse 1**  
How unsearchable Your ways, the highest words cannot portray  
How great You are  
You're so marvelously sweet, for all eternity repeat  
The heavenly song  

**Chorus**  
All I want is Jesus, all I want is Jesus  
And to behold the glory of Your face  
Is the only purpose I embrace  
It's the reason that I run this race  
'Cause all I want is Jesus  

**Verse 2**  
For heaven's throne is Yours alone  
Yet you made this earth Your home to break hell's power  
Though every knee must someday bow  
We will labor here and now for Kingdom come  

**Bridge**  
Strip everything away from me  
Lay all the kingdoms at my feet  
Still my only choice would be  
Forever and eternity
