# Once And For All  
  
_Chris Tomlin_  
  
**Verse 1**  
Once and for all  
The Father's love  
He is the light in the darkness  
Who took on flesh  
And took our place  
The weight of the world on His shoulders  
The weight of the world on His shoulders  
  
**Chorus**  
We believe our God is Jesus  
We believe that He is Lord  
We believe that He has saved us  
From sin and death  
Once and for all  
  
**Verse 2**  
Once and for all  
Our debt is paid  
There on the cross it is finished  
The Lamb of God for us was slain  
Up from the grave He is risen  
Up from the grave He is risen  
  
**Bridge**  
Jesus, Jesus  
God from God, Light from Light  
You are our salvation  
Jesus, Jesus  
God from God, Light from Light  
Your kingdom is forever
