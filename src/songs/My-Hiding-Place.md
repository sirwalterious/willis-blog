# My Hiding Place  
  
**Verse 1**  
Against the God who rules the sky  
I fought with hand uplifted high  
Despised the mention of His grace  
Too proud to seek a hiding place  
Enwrapped in thick Egyptian night  
And fond of darkness more than light  
Madly I ran the sinful race  
Secure without a hiding place.  
  
**Verse 2**  
But thus th’ eternal counsel ran  
“Almighty Love, arrest that man!”  
I felt the arrows of distress  
And found I had no hiding place  
Indignant justice stood in view  
To Sinai’s fiery mount I flew  
But Justice cried with frowning face  
“This mountain is no hiding place!"  
  
**Verse 3**  
Ere long a heavenly voice I heard  
And Mercy’s angel form appeared  
Who led me on with gentle pace  
To Jesus Christ, my hiding place  
On Him Almighty vengeance fell  
That must have sunk a world to hell  
He bore it for a chosen race  
And thus became their hiding place  
  
**Chorus**  
You are my hiding place  
You are salvation  
You are my hiding place  
You are deliverance  
  
**Verse 4**  
Should storms of sevenfold vengeance roll  
And shake this earth from pole to pole  
No flaming bolt could daunt my face  
For Jesus is my hiding place  
A few more rolling suns at most  
Shall land me safe on Heaven’s coast  
There I shall sing the song of grace  
To Jesus Christ, my hiding place!
