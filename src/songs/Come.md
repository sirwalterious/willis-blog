# Come

_Ben Zornes_

**Verse 1** 
On this pilgrim's passageway  
Filled with joys and trials and pains  
How we cry, come Lord Jesus, come  
In this dark and dreary world  
How we need Your light unfurled  
Oh we cry, come Lord Jesus, come  
Come Lord Jesus, come  

**Chorus**  
On the wings of the wind, with fire and with flame  
With the majesty and might of Thy Name above all names  
Their faith shall be sight and Christ shall be our light  
But still we pray, come Lord Jesus, come  

**Verse 2**  
Though we know You're sure to come  
And we know You'll take us home  
Even so, come Lord Jesus, come  
Though now we see You in part  
And You've made alive our hearts  
Even so, come Lord Jesus, come  

**Bridge**  
Come Lord Jesus (repeat)

**Verse 3**  
Oh hush my aching soul, the Lord shall not delay  
With flooding tears, come Lord Jesus, come  
The trump shall soon resound, our dear Lord shall descend  
Haste the day, come Lord Jesus, come
