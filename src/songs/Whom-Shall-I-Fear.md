# Whom Shall I Fear  
  
_Chris Tomlin_  
  
**Verse 1**  
You hear me when I call, You are my morning song  
Though darkness fills the night, it cannot hide the light  
Whom shall I fear  
  
**Verse 2**  
You crush the enemy, underneath my feet  
You are my sword and shield, though troubles linger still  
Whom shall I fear  
  
**Chorus**  
I know who goes before me, I know who stands behind  
The God of angel armies is always by my side  
The one who reigns forever, he is a friend of mine  
The God of angel armies is always by my side  
  
**Verse 3**  
My strength is in Your name, for You alone can save  
You will deliver me, Yours is the victory  
Whom shall I fear  
Whom shall I fear  
  
**Bridge**  
And nothing formed against me shall stand  
You hold the whole world in Your hands  
I'm holding on to Your promises  
You are faithful  
You are faithful
