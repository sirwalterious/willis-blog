# How Great Is Our God

_Chris Tomlin_

**Verse 1**  
The splendor of a King, clothed in majesty  
Let all the Earth rejoice  
All the Earth rejoice  
He wraps himself in light  
And darkness tries to hide  
And trembles at His voice  
Trembles at His voice  

**Chorus**  
How great is our God, sing with me  
How great is our God, and all will see  
How great, how great is our God  

**Verse 2**  
Age to age He stands  
And time is in His hands  
Beginning and the end  
The Godhead Three in One  
Father Spirit Son  
The Lion and the Lamb  
The Lion and the Lamb  

**Bridge**  
Name above all names  
Worthy of our praise  
My heart will sing  
How great is our God
