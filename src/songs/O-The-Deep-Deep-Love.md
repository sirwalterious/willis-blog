# O The Deep, Deep Love  
  
_Bob Kauflin_  
  
**Verse 1**  
Oh the deep, deep love of Jesus  
Vast, unmeasured, boundless, free  
Rolling as a mighty ocean  
In its fullness over me  
Underneath me, all around me  
Is the current of Your love  
Leading onward, leading homeward  
To Your glorious rest above  
  
**Chorus**  
Oh the deep, deep love  
All I need and trust  
Is the deep, deep love of Jesus  
  
**Verse 2**  
Oh the deep, deep love of Jesus  
Spread His praise from shore to shore  
How He came to pay our ransom  
Through the saving cross He bore  
How He watches o’er His loved ones  
Those He died to make His own  
How for them He’s interceding  
Pleading now before the throne  
  
**Verse 3**  
Oh the deep, deep love of Jesus  
Far surpassing all the rest  
It’s an ocean full of blessing  
In the midst of every test  
Oh the deep, deep love of Jesus  
Mighty Savior, precious Friend  
You will bring us home to glory  
Where Your love will never end
