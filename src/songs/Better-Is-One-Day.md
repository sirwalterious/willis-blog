# Better Is One Day

_Matt Redman_

**Verse 1**  
How lovely is Your dwelling place  
O Lord Almighty  
My soul longs and even faints for You  
For here my heart is satisfied  
Within Your presence  
I sing beneath the shadow of Your wings  

**Chorus**  
Better is one day in Your courts  
Better is one day in Your house  
Better is one day in Your courts  
Than thousands elsewhere  

**Verse 2**  
One thing I ask, and I would seek  
To see Your beauty  
To find You in the place Your glory dwells  
Your glory dwells
