# Jesus The Name High Over All  
  
_Chris Eaton, Gareth Robinson, John Hartley_  
  
**Verse 1**  
Jesus, the name high over all  
In hell or earth or sky  
Angels and men before it fall  
And devils fear and fly  
Jesus, the name to sinners dear  
The name to sinners giv'n  
It scatters all their guilty fear  
And turns their hell in heav'n  
  
**Chorus**  
O, that the world might taste and see  
The riches of His grace  
The arms of love that compass me  
Would all the world embrace  
  
**Verse 3**  
Jesus, the prisoner's fetters breaks  
And bruises satan's head  
Power into strengthless souls it speaks  
And life into the dead  
Thee I shall constantly proclaim  
Though earth and hell oppose  
Bold to confess Thy glorious Name  
Before a world of foes  
  
**Verse 3**  
His only righteouness I show  
His saving truth proclaim  
'Tis all my business here below  
To cry 'behold the Lamb'  
Happy, if with my latest breath  
I may but gasp His name  
Preach Him to all, and cry in death  
'Behold, behold the Lamb!'
