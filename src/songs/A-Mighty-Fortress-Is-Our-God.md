# A Mighty Fortress Is Our God  
  
_Martin Luther_  
  
**Verse 1**  
A mighty fortress is our God, a bulwark never failing  
Our helper He, amid the flood of mortal ills prevailing:  
For still our ancient foe doth seek to work us woe  
His craft and pow’r are great, and, armed with cruel hate  
On earth is not his equal  
  
**Verse 2**  
Did we in our own strength confide, our striving would be losing  
Were not the right Man on our side, the Man of God’s own choosing:  
Dost ask who that may be? Christ Jesus, it is He  
Lord Sabaoth, His Name, from age to age the same  
And He must win the battle  
  
**Verse 3**  
And though this world, with devils filled, should threaten to undo us  
We will not fear, for God hath willed His truth to triumph through us  
The Prince of Darkness grim, we tremble not for him  
His rage we can endure, for lo, his doom is sure  
One little word shall fell him  
  
**Verse 4**  
That word above all earthly pow’rs, no thanks to them, abideth  
The Spirit and the gifts are ours through Him Who with us sideth  
Let goods and kindred go, this mortal life also  
The body they may kill: God’s truth abideth still  
His kingdom is forever
