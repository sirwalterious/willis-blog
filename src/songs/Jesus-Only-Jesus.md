# Jesus, Only Jesus  
  
_Matt Redman_  
  
**Verse 1**  
Who has the power to raise the dead?  
Who can save us from our sin?  
He is our hope, our righteousness  
Jesus, only Jesus  
  
**Verse 2**  
Who can make the blind to see?  
Who holds the keys that set us free?  
He paid it all to bring us peace  
Jesus, only Jesus  
  
**Chorus**  
Holy, King almighty Lord  
Saints and angels all adore  
I join with them and bow before  
Jesus, only Jesus  
  
**Bridge**  
Who can command the highest praise?  
Who has the name above all names?  
You stand alone, I stand amazed  
Jesus, only Jesus  
  
**Bridge 2**  
You will command the highest praise  
Yours is the name above all names  
You stand alone, I stand amazed  
Jesus, only Jesus
