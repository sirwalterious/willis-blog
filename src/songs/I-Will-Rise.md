# I Will Rise  
  
_Chris Tomlin_  
  
**Verse 1**  
There's a peace I've come to know  
Though my heart and flesh may fail  
There's an anchor for my soul  
I can say "It is well"  
  
**Pre-Chorus**  
Jesus has overcome  
And the grave is overwhelmed  
The victory is won  
He is risen from the dead  
  
**Chorus**  
And I will rise when He calls my name  
No more sorrow, no more pain  
I will rise on eagles' wings  
Before my God fall on my knees  
And rise  
I will rise  
  
**Verse 2**  
There's a day that's drawing near  
When this darkness breaks to light  
And the shadows disappear  
And my faith shall be my eyes  
  
**Bridge**  
And I hear the voice of many angels sing  
"Worthy is the Lamb"  
And I hear the cry of every longing heart  
"Worthy is the Lamb"
