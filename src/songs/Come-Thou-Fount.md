# Come Thou Fount

_Robert Robinson_

**Verse 1**  
Come, Thou Fount of every blessing  
Tune my heart to sing Thy grace  
Streams of mercy, never ceasing  
Call for songs of loudest praise  
Teach me some melodious sonnet  
Sung by flaming tongues above  

**Verse 2**  
Praise the mount! I’m fixed upon it  
Mount of Thy redeeming love  
Here I’ll raise my Ebenezer  
Hither by Thy help I’m come  
And I hope, by Thy good pleasure   
Safely to arrive at home  
Jesus sought me when a stranger  
Wand’ring from the fold of God  
He, to rescue me from danger  
Interposed His precious blood  

**Verse 3**  
Oh, to grace how great a debtor  
Daily I’m constrained to be  
Let Thy goodness, like a fetter  
Bind my feeble heart to Thee  
Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it  
Prone to leave the God I love  
Here’s my heart, O take and seal it   
Seal it for thy courts above  

**Verse 4**   
Hallelujah! I have found it  
The full cleansing I had craved  
And to all the world I’ll sound it  
They too may be wholly saved  
I am sealed by Thy sweet Spirit  
Prone no longer now to roam  
And Thy voice, I’ll humbly hear it  
For Thy presence is my home
