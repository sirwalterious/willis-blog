# Even So Come

_Jason Ingram, Chris Tomlin, Jess Cates_

**Verse 1**  
All of creation, all of the earth  
Make straight a highway, a path for the Lord  
Jesus is coming soon  
Call back the sinner, wake up the saint  
Let every nation shout of Your fame  
Jesus is coming soon

**Chorus**  
Like a bride waiting for her groom  
We'll be a Church ready for You  
Every heart longing for our King  
We sing, "even so come"
Lord Jesus, come  
Even so come  
Lord Jesus, come

**Verse 2**  
There will be justice, all will be new  
Your name forever, faithful and true  
Jesus is coming soon
