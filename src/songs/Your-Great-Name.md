# Your Great Name  
  
_Michael Neale, Krissy Nordhoff_  
  
**Verse 1**  
Lost are saved, find their way  
At the sound of Your great name  
All condemned, feel no shame  
At the sound of Your great name  
Every fear, has no place  
At the sound of Your great name  
The enemy, he has to leave  
At the sound of Your great name  
  
**Chorus**  
Jesus, worthy is the lamb that was slain for us  
Son of God and man, You are high and lifted up   
And all the world will praise Your great name  
  
**Verse 2**  
All the weak, find their strength  
At the sound of Your great name  
Hungry souls, receive grace  
At the sound of Your great name  
The fatherless, they find their rest  
At the sound of Your great name  
Sick are healed, and the dead are raised  
At the sound of Your great name  
  
**Bridge**  
Redeemer, my healer, Lord Almighty  
My Savior, defender, You are my King (repeat)
