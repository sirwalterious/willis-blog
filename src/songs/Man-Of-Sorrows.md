# Man Of Sorrows

_Philip P. Bliss_

**Verse 1**  
“Man of Sorrows!” what a name  
For the Son of God, who came  
Ruined sinners to reclaim  
Hallelujah! What a Savior!  

**Verse 2**  
Bearing shame and scoffing rude  
In my place condemned He stood  
Sealed my pardon with His blood  
Hallelujah! What a Savior!

**Verse 3**  
Guilty, vile, and helpless we  
Spotless Lamb of God was He  
“Full atonement!” can it be?  
Hallelujah! What a Savior!

**Verse 4**  
Lifted up was He to die  
“It is finished!” was His cry  
Now in Heav’n exalted high  
Hallelujah! What a Savior!

**Verse 5**  
When He comes, our glorious King  
All His ransomed home to bring  
Then anew His song we’ll sing  
Hallelujah! What a Savior!
