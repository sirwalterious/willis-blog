# Crown Him With Many Crowns (Majesty)

_Matthew Bridges, Chris Tomlin_

**Verse 1**  
Crown him with many crowns the Lamb upon his throne  
Hark! how the heavenly anthem drowns all music but its own  
Awake, my soul, and sing of him who died for thee  
And hail him as thy matchless king through all eternity  

**Verse 2**  
Crown him the Lord of love behold his hands and side  
Rich wounds, yet visible above, in beauty glorified  
No angels in the sky can fully bear that sight  
But downward bends their burning eye at mysteries so bright

**Chorus**  
Majesty, Lord of all  
Let every throne before him fall  
The King of kings, O come adore  
Our God who reigns forevermore

**Verse 3**  
Crown him the Lord of life who triumphed o'er the grave  
And rose victorious in the strife for those he came to save  
His glories now we sing who died and rose on high  
Who died eternal life to bring and lives that death may die  

**Bridge**  
All hail Redeemer, hail  
For He has died for me  
His praise and glory shall not fail  
Through all eternity  

**Verse 4**  
Crown him the Lord of all, enthroned on worlds above  
Crown him the King to whom is given the wondrous name of love  
Crown him with many crowns, as thrones before him fall  
Crown him ye kings with many crowns, for He is King of all
