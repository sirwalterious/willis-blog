# Lord I Need You  
  
_Matt Maher_  
  
**Verse 1**  
Lord, I come, I confess  
Bowing here I find my rest  
Without You I fall apart  
You're the One that guides my heart  
  
**Chorus**  
Lord, I need You, oh, I need You  
Every hour I need You  
My one defense, my righteousness  
Oh God, how I need You  
  
**Verse 2**  
Where sin runs deep Your grace is more  
Where grace is found is where You are  
Where You are, Lord, I am free  
Holiness is Christ in me  
  
**Bridge**  
So teach my song to rise to You  
When temptation comes my way  
When I cannot stand I'll fall on You  
Jesus, You're my hope and stay
