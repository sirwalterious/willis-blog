# God Most High

_Ben Zornes_

**Verse 1**  
You dwell in light so bright, it pierces the darkest place  
You sit enthroned on high, upholding the worlds by Your word  
There is none like You, there never was and never will be

**Chorus**  
God most high, God most high  
The Father of Light the Giver of life  
The perfect Lamb and offering  
The saints and angels sing  
Glory to our King God most high

**Verse 2**  
Your strength endures all time, You have no beginning or end  
Your thoughts are high above, surpassing all we comprehend  
You are high above, You always were and ever will be

**Bridge**  
With Your voice of thunder fill the earth with wonder   
You bring all things under, Your great command
