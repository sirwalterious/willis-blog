# Glorious And Mighty

_Bob Kauflin, Joel Sczebel, Todd Twining_

**Verse 1**  
Majesty, Your glory is shining  
Brighter than the moon and the stars  
Marveling, we honor and fear You  
Above all gods

**Chorus**  
Glorious and mighty, You’re awesome In beauty  
Joyful songs we raise  
Glorious and mighty, You’re awesome in beauty  
Greatly to be praised

**Verse 2**  
Majesty, You fashioned the heavens  
Your decrees can never be changed  
Over all the plans of the nations  
Your judgments reign

**Verse 3**  
Majesty, we’ll sing with creation  
When You come again in the clouds  
Every knee will bow down and worship  
The one true God
