# There Is A Redeemer  
  
_Keith Green_  
  
**Verse 1**  
There is a redeemer  
Jesus, God's own Son  
Precious Lamb of God, Messiah  
Holy One  
  
**Verse 2**  
Jesus my redeemer  
Name above all names  
Precious Lamb of God, Messiah  
Oh, for sinners slain  
  
**Chorus**  
Thank you, oh my father  
For giving us Your Son  
And leaving Your Spirit  
'Til the work on Earth is done  
  
**Verse 3**  
When I stand in Glory  
I will see His face  
And there I'll serve my King forever  
In that Holy Place
