# Give Me Jesus

**Verse 1**  
In the morning, when I rise  
In the morning, when I rise  
In the morning, when I rise  

**Chorus**  
Give me Jesus  
Give me Jesus  
Give me Jesus  
You can have all this world  
Just give me Jesus

**Verse 2**  
When I am alone   
When I am alone  
When I am alone  
Give me Jesus  

**Verse 3**  
When I come to die  
When I come to die  
When I come to die  
Give me Jesus
