# Blessed Be Your Name

_Matt Redman_

**Verse 1**  
Blessed Be Your Name in the land that is plentiful  
Where Your streams of abundance flow   
Blessed be Your name  
Blessed Be Your name when I'm found in the desert place  
Though I walk through the wilderness  
Blessed Be Your name  
Every blessing You pour out I'll turn back to praise  
When the darkness closes in, Lord, still I will say

**Chorus**  
Blessed be the name of the Lord  
Blessed be Your name  
Blessed be the name of the Lord  
Blessed be Your glorious name  

**Verse 2**  
Blessed be Your name when the sun's shining down on me  
When the world's 'all as it should be  
Blessed be Your name  
Blessed be Your name on the road marked with suffering  
Though there's pain in the offering  
Blessed be Your name  
Every blessing You pour out I'll turn back to praise  
When the darkness closes in, Lord, still I will say  

**Bridge**  
You give and take away  
You give and take away  
My heart will choose to say  
Lord, blessed be Your name
