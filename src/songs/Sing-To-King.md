# Sing To The King  
  
_Billy Foote_  
  
**Verse 1**  
Sing to the king who is coming to reign  
Glory to Jesus the lamb that was slain  
Life and salvation his empire shall bring  
And joy to the nations, when Jesus is king  
  
**Chorus**  
Come, let us sing a song  
A song declaring we belong to Jesus   
He is all we need  
Lift up a heart of praise   
Sing now with voices raised to Jesus    
Sing to the king  
  
**Verse 2**  
Souls shall be saved from the burden of sin,  
Doubt shall not darken His witness within,  
Hell hath no terrors, and death hath no sting;  
Love is victorious when Jesus is King.  
  
**Verse 3**  
For his returning we watch and we pray  
Hasten, O Father, the dawn of that day  
We'll join in singing with all the redeemed  
Cause Satan is vanquished and Jesus is king
