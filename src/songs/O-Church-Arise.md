# O Church Arise  
  
_Keith and Kristyn Getty_  
  
**Verse 2**  
O church, arise and put your armor on  
Hear the call of Christ our captain  
For now the weak can say that they are strong  
In the strength that God has given  
With shield of faith and belt of truth  
We'll stand against the devil's lies  
An army bold whose battle cry is "Love!"  
Reaching out to those in darkness  
  
**Verse 3**  
Our call to war, to love the captive soul  
But to rage against the captor  
And with the sword that makes the wounded whole  
We will fight with faith and valor  
When faced with trials on ev'ry side  
We know the outcome is secure  
And Christ will have the prize for which He diedâ€”  
An inheritance of nations  
  
**Verse 4**  
Come, see the cross where love and mercy meet  
As the Son of God is stricken  
Then see His foes lie crushed beneath His feet  
For the Conqueror has risen!  
And as the stone is rolled away  
And Christ emerges from the grave  
This vict'ry march continues till the day  
Ev'ry eye and heart shall see Him  
  
**Verse 5**  
So Spirit, come, put strength in ev'ry stride  
Give grace for ev'ry hurdle  
That we may run with faith to win the prize  
Of a servant good and faithful  
As saints of old still line the way  
Retelling triumphs of His grace  
We hear their calls and hunger for the day  
When, with Christ, we stand in glory
