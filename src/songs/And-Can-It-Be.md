# And Can It be

_Charles Wesley_

**Verse 1**  
And can it be that I should gain  
An interest in the Savior’s blood  
Died He for me, who caused His pain  
For me, who Him to death pursued 
Amazing love! How can it be  
That Thou, my God, shouldst die for me  
Amazing love! How can it be  
That Thou, my God, shouldst die for me  

**Verse 2**  
'Tis myst’ry all: the Immortal dies  
Who can explore His strange design  
In vain the firstborn seraph tries  
To sound the depths of love divine  
’Tis mercy all! Let earth adore  
Let angel minds inquire no more  
’Tis mercy all! Let earth adore  
Let angel minds inquire no more  

**Verse 3**  
He left His Father’s throne above  
So free, so infinite His grace  
Emptied Himself of all but love  
And bled for Adam’s helpless race  
’Tis mercy all, immense and free  
For, O my God, it found out me  
’Tis mercy all, immense and free  
For, O my God, it found out me  

**Verse 4**  
Long my imprisoned spirit lay  
Fast bound in sin and nature’s night  
Thine eye diffused a quick’ning ray  
I woke, the dungeon flamed with light  
My chains fell off, my heart was free   
I rose, went forth, and followed Thee  
My chains fell off, my heart was free   
I rose, went forth, and followed Thee  

**Verse 5**  
No condemnation now I dread  
Jesus, and all in Him, is mine  
Alive in Him, my living Head  
And clothed in righteousness divine  
Bold I approach th’ eternal throne  
And claim the crown, through Christ my own  
Bold I approach th’ eternal throne  
And claim the crown, through Christ my own
