# More Love To Thee  
  
_Elizabeth P. Prentiss_  
  
**Verse 1**  
More love to Thee, O Christ, more love to Thee!  
Hear Thou the prayer I make on bended knee  
This is my earnest plea: More love, O Christ, to Thee  
More love to Thee, more love to Thee!  
  
**Verse 2**  
Once earthly joy I craved, sought peace and rest  
Now Thee alone I seek, give what is best  
This all my prayer shall be: More love, O Christ, to Thee  
More love to Thee, more love to Thee!  
  
**Verse 3**  
Let sorrow do its work, come grief or pain  
Sweet are Thy messengers, sweet their refrain  
When they can sing with me: More love, O Christ, to Thee  
More love to Thee, more love to Thee!  
  
**Verse 4**  
Then shall my latest breath whisper Thy praise  
This be the parting cry my heart shall raise  
This still its prayer shall be: More love, O Christ, to Thee  
More love to Thee, more love to Thee!
