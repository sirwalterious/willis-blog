# How Can I Keep From singing

_Eithne Ni Bhraonain, Nicky Ryan, Roma Shane Ryan_

**Verse 1**  
There is an endless song, echoes in my soul  
I hear the music ring  
And though the storms may come, I am holding on  
To the rock I cling

**Chorus**  
How can I keep from singing Your praise  
How can I ever say enough  
How amazing is Your love  
How can I keep from shouting Your name  
I know I am loved by the King  
And it makes my heart want to sing  

**Verse 2**  
I will lift my eyes in the darkest night  
For I know my Savior lives
And I will walk with You knowing You'll see me through  
And sing the songs You give

**Bridge**  
I can sing in the troubled times  
Sing when I win  
I can sing when I lose my step  
And fall down again  
I can sing 'cause You pick me up  
Sing 'cause You're there  
I can sing 'cause You hear me, Lord  
When I call to You in prayer  
I can sing with my last breath  
Sing for I know  
That I'll sing with the angels  
And the saints around the throne
