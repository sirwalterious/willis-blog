# Awake

_Ben Zornes_

**Verse 1**  
You are meekness and majesty  
You are sweetness and valiancy  
All bound up in One, O bright heaven's sun  
You are flawless with finality  
You are endless in eternity  
You're all we need, O beautiful King  

**Chorus**  
Awake, awake, O arm of the Lord  
Put on strength, put on strength as in the ancient days  
And for Your glory and for Your praise  
O great Almighty God, Awake  

**Verse 2**   
We are weary and thirsty here  
O how we need Your presence here  
O beautiful King, to You we must cling  
For power, fame and glory Lord  
And every praise Your grace affords  
We give unto You, O come make us new  

**Bridge**  
You've wounded the dragon  
He has no power  
We now overcome, the battle is won  
The devil strives to fight and win  
But Christ the Lord defeated him  
So triumph once more, glorious King we adore
