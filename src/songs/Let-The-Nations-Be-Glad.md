# Let The Nations Be Glad  
  
_Matt Boswell_  
  
**Verse 1**  
Let the glory of the Lord forever be our joy  
May redemption be the theme of our song  
For by grace we have been saved  
And by grace we shall proclaim  
To the corners of the earth that Christ has come  
  
**Chorus**  
Let the nations be glad  
Let the peoples rejoice  
For salvation belongs to our God  
Let the whole earth be filled  
With the praises of the Lord  
For salvation belongs to our God  
Let the nations be glad  
  
**Verse 2**  
Through the ages gone before  
Through the trial and the sword  
Many saints and martyrs conquered, though they died  
Still we're holding out the cross  
Crossing oceans, suffering loss  
Shall endure all things to win the crown of life  
  
**Verse 3**  
As Your holy church goes forth  
In the Holy Spirit's power  
With the glories of the gospel to explain  
Now we pray Your kingdom come  
And we pray Your will be done  
For the honor and the glory of Your name
