# How Sweet The Name Of Jesus Sounds

_John Newton_

**Verse 1**  
How sweet the name of Jesus sounds  
In a believer’s ear  
It soothes his sorrows, heals his wounds  
And drives away his fear  

**Verse 2**  
It makes the wounded spirit whole  
And calms the troubled breast  
’Tis manna to the hungry soul  
And to the weary, rest  

**Verse 3**  
Dear Name! the Rock on which I build  
My Shield and Hiding Place  
My never-failing Treas’ry filled  
With boundless stores of grace  

**Verse 4**  
Jesus! my Shepherd, Husband, Friend  
My Prophet, Priest, and King  
My Lord, my Life, my Way, my End  
Accept the praise I bring  

**Verse 5**  
Weak is the effort of my heart  
And cold my warmest thought  
But when I see Thee as Thou art  
I’ll praise Thee as I ought  

**Verse 6**  
Till then I would Thy love proclaim  
With every fleeting breath  
And may the music of Thy name  
Refresh my soul in death
