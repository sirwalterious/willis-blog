# Always

_Kristian Stanfill_

**Verse 1**  
My foes are many, they rise against me  
But I will hold my ground  
I will not fear the war, I will not fear the storm  
My help is on the way, my help is on the way

**Chorus**  
Oh, my God, He will not delay  
My refuge and strength always  
I will not fear, His promise is true  
My God will come through always, always

**Verse 2**  
Troubles surround me, chaos abounding  
My soul will rest in You  
I will not fear the war, I will not fear the storm  
My help is on the way, my help is on the way 

**Bridge**  
I lift my eyes up, my help comes from the Lord (repeat)
