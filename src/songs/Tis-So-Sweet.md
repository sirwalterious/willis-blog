# 'Tis So Sweet  
  
_Louisa M. R. Stead_  
  
**Verse 1**  
’Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus
Just to take Him at His Word
Just to rest upon His promise
And to know, “Thus saith the Lord!”  
  
**Refrain**  
Jesus, Jesus, how I trust Him!  
How I’ve proved Him o’er and o’er
Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus!  
Oh, for grace to trust Him more!  
  
**Verse 2**  
Oh, how sweet to trust in Jesus
Just to trust His cleansing blood
And in simple faith to plunge me  
’Neath the healing, cleansing flood!  
  
**Verse 3**  
Yes, ’tis sweet to trust in Jesus
Just from sin and self to cease
Just from Jesus simply taking  
Life and rest, and joy and peace
  
**Verse**  
I’m so glad I learned to trust Thee
Precious Jesus, Savior, Friend
And I know that Thou art with me
Wilt be with me to the end
