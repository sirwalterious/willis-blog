# Christ The Lord

_Ben Zornes_

**Verse 1**  
In the darkness of the night In the brightness of the day  
In the storm, or in the calm I have found a song to sing  
When the storm grows dark and dim In the midst of shadows grim    
I may be weak, Christ is strong He’s become my midnight song  

**Chorus**  
Christ the Lord, Christ the Lord  
God Almighty dwells within  
I’m a conqueror through Him  
Christ alone shall my heart adore  
And through the wind and waves I’ll stand  
For I’m held in the hallow of the hands   
Of Christ the Lord

**Verse 2**  
When all the force of Satan’s might  
Makes it seem like nothing’s right  
The child of God can lift his voice  
“I am redeemed and I can rejoice.”  

**Bridge**  
Though the earth be removed and fall to the sea  
Though the host of hell seem so overwhelming  
In the valley of death’s darkest shadow  
I can stand for Christ has won the battle  
Though weeping may endure for the night  
Joy is sure to come in the morning  

**Tag**  
My redeemer gives me songs in the night  
and upholds me by the promise of the light  
of Christ the Lord
