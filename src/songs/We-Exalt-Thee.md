# We Exalt Thee  
  
**Verse 1**  
For Thou O Lord art high above all the earth  
Thou art exalted far above all gods  
For Thy love O Lord, is better than life  
And Thy presence far sweeter than wine  
  
**Chorus**  
We exalt Thee  
We exalt Thee  
We exalt Thee, O Lord  
We exalt Thee  
We exalt Thee  
We exalt Thee, O Lord
