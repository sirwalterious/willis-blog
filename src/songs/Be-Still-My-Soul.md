# Be Still My Soul

_Katharina A. von Schlegel_

**Verse 1**  
Be still, my soul: the Lord is on thy side  
Bear patiently the cross of grief or pain  
Leave to thy God to order and provide  
In every change, He faithful will remain  
Be still, my soul: thy best, thy heav’nly Friend  
Through thorny ways leads to a joyful end  

**Verse 2**  
Be still, my soul: thy God doth undertake  
To guide the future, as He has the past  
Thy hope, thy confidence let nothing shake  
All now mysterious shall be bright at last  
Be still, my soul: the waves and winds still know  
His voice Who ruled them while He dwelt below  

**Verse 3**  
Be still, my soul: when dearest friends depart  
And all is darkened in the vale of tears  
Then shalt thou better know His love, His heart  
Who comes to soothe thy sorrow and thy fears  
Be still, my soul: thy Jesus can repay  
From His own fullness all He takes away  

**Verse 4**  
Be still, my soul: the hour is hast’ning on  
When we shall be forever with the Lord  
When disappointment, grief, and fear are gone  
Sorrow forgot, love’s purest joys restored  
Be still, my soul: when change and tears are past  
All safe and blessed we shall meet at last
