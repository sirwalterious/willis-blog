# There Is Power In The Blood  
  
_Lewis E. Jones_  
  
**Verse 1**  
Would you be free from the burden of sin?  
There’s pow’r in the blood, pow’r in the blood  
Would you o’er evil a victory win?  
There’s wonderful pow’r in the blood  
  
**Refrain**  
There is pow’r, pow’r, wonder-working pow’r  
In the blood of the Lamb  
There is pow’r, pow’r, wonder-working pow’r  
In the precious blood of the Lamb  
  
**Verse 2**  
Would you be free from your passion and pride?  
There’s pow’r in the blood, pow’r in the blood  
Come for a cleansing to Calvary’s tide  
There’s wonderful pow’r in the blood  
  
**Verse 3**  
Would you be whiter, much whiter than snow?  
There’s pow’r in the blood, pow’r in the blood  
Sin-stains are lost in its life-giving flow  
There’s wonderful pow’r in the blood  
  
**Verse 4**  
Would you do service for Jesus your King?  
There’s pow’r in the blood, pow’r in the blood  
Would you live daily His praises to sing?  
There’s wonderful pow’r in the blood
