# I Have Decided To Follow Jesus

_S. Sundar Singh_

**Verse 1**  
I have decided to follow Jesus  
I have decided to follow Jesus  
I have decided to follow Jesus  
No turning back, no turning back 

**Verse 2**  
The world behind me, the cross before me  
The world behind me, the cross before me  
The world behind me, the cross before me  
No turning back, no turning back

**Verse 3**  
Though none go with me, still I will follow  
Though none go with me, still I will follow  
Though none go with me, still I will follow  
No turning back, no turning back

**Verse 4**  
My cross I’ll carry, till I see Jesus  
My cross I’ll carry, till I see Jesus  
My cross I’ll carry, till I see Jesus  
No turning back, no turning back
