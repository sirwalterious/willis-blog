# God The Uncreated One

_Aaron Keyes_

**Verse 1**  
God the uncreated One  
The author of salvation  
Wrote the laws of space and time  
And fashioned worlds to his design  
The One whom angel hosts revere  
Hung the stars like chandeliers  
Numbered every grain of sand  
Knows the heart of every man  
He is King forever, He is King forever  
He is King forevermore

**Verse 2**  
God our fortress and our strength  
The rock on which we can depend  
Matchless in his majesty  
His power and authority  
Unshaken by the schemes of man  
Never-changing, Great I Am  
Kingdoms rise and kingdoms fall  
He is faithful through it all  
Crown him King forever, crown him King forever  
Crown him King forevermore

**Verse 3**  
Mighty God in mortal flesh  
Forsaken by a traitor's kiss  
The curse of sin and centuries  
Did pierce the lowly Prince of Peace  
Lifted high, the sinless man  
Crucified, the spotless Lamb  
Buried by the sons of man  
Rescued by the Father's hand  
To reign as King forever, reign as King forever  
Reign as King forevermore

**Verse 4**  
King Eternal, God of Grace  
We crown You with the highest praise  
Heaven shouts and saints adore  
You're Holy, Holy, Holy Lord!  
What joy in everlasting life  
All is love and faith is sight  
Justice rolls and praises rise  
At the Name of Jesus Christ  
King of Kings forever, King of Kings forever 
King of Kings forevermore
