# Praise His Name  
  
_Steven Sivley_  
  
**Verse 1**  
Our God was King before the world began  
Praise His name, Praise His name  
He made the earth, laid out the heavens  
Praise His Name, Praise His Name  
The Father spoke into existence  
The breath of life to Adam’s race  
When it was so he saw that it was good  
Praise His name, Praise His name  
  
**Verse 2**  
He chose to love the seed of Abraham  
Praise His name, Praise His name  
He was their God they were His people  
Praise His name, Praise His name  
But now this grace that was upon them  
He freely gives unto us all  
His mercy flows with loving kindness  
Praise His name, Praise His name  
  
**Verse 3**  
When we were dead in our transgressions  
Praise His name, Praise His name  
Jesus acquired our shame and penalty  
Praise His name, Praise His name  
The wrath of God unleashed upon Him  
He bled and died and rose again  
Now seated with our Sovereign Father  
Praise His name, Praise His name  
  
**Verse 4**  
We have a hope in all His promises  
Praise His name, Praise His name  
We’ll shed no tears nor face the enemy  
Praise His name, Praise His name  
No sin or death shall press against us  
Forevermore our song will be  
Of our great God who reigns eternally  
Praise His name, Praise His name
