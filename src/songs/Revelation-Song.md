# Revelation Song  
  
_Kari Jobe_  
  
**Verse 1**  
Worthy is the Lamb who was slain  
Holy, holy is Thee  
Sing a new song to Him who sits on  
Heaven's mercy seat  
  
**Chorus**  
Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty  
Who was and is and is to come  
With all creation I sing praise to the King of kings  
You are my everything and I will adore You  
  
**Verse 2**  
Clothed in rainbows of living color  
Flashes of lighting rolls of thunder  
Blessing and honor strength and glory and power be  
To You the only one who's King  
  
**Verse 3**  
Filled with wonder awestruck wonder  
At the mention of Your name  
Jesus Your name is power, breath and living water  
Such a marvelous mystery
