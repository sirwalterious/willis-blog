# Because I Love You

_Ben Zornes_

**Verse 1**  
Oh Prince and Ruler of my heart I know I’ve only seen a part  
Of all Your humble agonies which you endured to rescue me  
A thousand hearts would be too few to fully love and treasure You  
But I have just one heart to give so here it is and may it be Your throne  

**Pre-Chorus**  
So whether I live or I die  
May this be the chorus of my parting cry  

**Chorus**  
May the passion and the purpose of my life  
Be summarized in glorifying Christ  
You are the overwhelming yearning of my soul  
No matter what I must endure I’ll gladly go  
Because I love you Lord, because I love You Lord

**Verse 2**  
I truly long to bring You praise as I walk the narrow way  
So wean my soul of earthly things, by purging me through pain and suffering  

**Bridge**  
Because I love You Lord oh how I love You Lord  
Though all the world would mock Your truth I’ll delight to follow You  
Not like a duty-driven Pharisee but from a joyful heart that loves You so
