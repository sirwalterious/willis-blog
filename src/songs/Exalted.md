# Exalted

_Chris Tomlin_

**Verse 1**  
Exalted, he is exalted  
On high, he is exalted  
Great is the Lord, let all the nations say  
Exalted, he is exalted  

**Chorus**  
Blessing and honor, glory and power 
Unto the Lord be praised  
Sing with a chorus resounding before us  
Holy is his name, his name  

**Bridge**  
Yahweh, holy is your name
