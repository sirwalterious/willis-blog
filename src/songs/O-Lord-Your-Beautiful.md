# O Lord, You're Beautiful  
  
_Keith Green_  
  
**Verse 1**  
Oh Lord, you're beautiful  
Your face is all I see  
For when your eyes are on this child  
Your grace abounds to me  
  
**Chorus**  
I want to take your word and shine it all around  
But first help me to just, live it Lord  
And when I'm doing well, help me to never seek a crown  
For my reward is giving glory to you  
  
**Verse 2**  
Oh Lord, please light the fire  
That once burned bright and clean  
Replace the lamp of my first love  
That burns with holy fear
