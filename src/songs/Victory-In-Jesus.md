# Victory In Jesus  
  
_E. M. Bartlett_  
  
**Verse 1**  
I heard an old, old story, how a Savior came from Glory  
How He gave His life on Calvary, to save a wretch like me  
I heard about his groaning, of his precious blood's atoning  
Then I repented of my sins, and won the Victory  
  
**Chorus**   
Oh, Victory in Jesus, my Savior forever  
He sought me and he bought me with His redeeming blood  
He loved me ere I knew Him, and all my love is due Him  
He plunged me to Victory, beneath the cleansing flood  
  
**Verse 2**   
I heard about His healing, of His cleansing power revealing  
How He made the lame to walk again and caused the blind to see  
And then I cried, "Dear Jesus, come and heal my broken spirit."  
And some how Jesus came and brought to me the Victory  
  
**Verse 3**   
I heard about a mansion He has built for me in glory  
And I heard about the streets of gold beyond the crystal sea  
About the angels singing, and the old redemption story  
And some sweet day I'll sing up there the song of Victory!
