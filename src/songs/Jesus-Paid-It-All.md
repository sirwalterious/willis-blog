# Jesus Paid It All  
  
_Elvina M. Hall_  
  
**Verse 1**  
I hear the Savior say “Thy strength indeed is small  
Child of weakness, watch and pray, find in Me thine all in all.”  
  
**Refrain**  
Jesus paid it all, all to Him I owe;  
Sin had left a crimson stain, He washed it white as snow  
  
**Verse 2**  
For nothing good have I whereby Thy grace to claim  
I’ll wash my garments white in the blood of Calv’ry’s Lamb  
  
**Verse 3**  
And now complete in Him, my robe, His righteousness  
Close sheltered ’neath His side, I am divinely blest  
  
**Verse 4**  
Lord, now indeed I find, thy pow’r, and Thine alone  
Can change the leopard's spots, and melt the heart of stone  
  
**Verse 5**  
And when before the throne I stand in Him complete  
“Jesus died my soul to save,” my lips shall still repeat
