# Here Is Love

_William Rees_

**Verse 1**  
Here is love, vast as the ocean  
Loving-kindness as the flood  
When the Prince of Life, our Ransom  
Shed for us His precious blood  
Who His love will not remember?  
Who can cease to sing His praise?  
He can never be forgotten  
Throughout heav’n’s eternal days

**Verse 2**  
On the mount of crucifixion  
Fountains opened deep and wide  
Through the floodgates of God’s mercy  
Flowed a vast and gracious tide  
Grace and love, like mighty rivers  
Poured incessant from above  
And heav’n’s peace and perfect justice  
Kissed a guilty world in love  

**Verse 3**  
Let me, all Thy love accepting  
Love Thee, ever all my days  
Let me seek Thy kingdom only  
And my life be to Thy praise  
Thou alone shalt be my glory  
Nothing in the world I see  
Thou hast cleansed and sanctified me  
Thou Thyself hast set me free

**Verse 4**  
In Thy truth Thou dost direct me  
By Thy Spirit through Thy Word  
And Thy grace my need is meeting  
As I trust in Thee, my Lord  
Of Thy fullness Thou art pouring  
Thy great love and pow’r on me  
Without measure, full and boundless  
Drawing out my heart to Thee
