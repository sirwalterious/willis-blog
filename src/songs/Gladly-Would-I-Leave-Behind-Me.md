# Gladly Would I Leave Behind Me

_Doug Plank_

**Verse 1**  
Gladly would I leave behind me all the pleasure I have known  
To pursue surpassing treasures at the throne of God the Son  
Worthy of unending worship love and loveliness is He  
By His precious death were millions from the jaws of death set free

**Verse 2**  
Gladly would I give to Jesus all affection, everything  
For the washing of His mercy makes my ransomed heart to sing  
"Holy, holy!" is the chorus, rising up from those who see  
Christ exalted, bright and burning full of pow'r and purity  

**Chorus**  
Where else can I go? Jesus, You're the One  
That I was made to know what else can I do?  
Jesus, You're my all I gladly run to You

**Verse 3**  
Gladly would I flee temptations for their troubles fill my life  
Turn and seek my God and Savior for His goodness satisfies  
Earthly treasures, all are passing thieves break in and rust destroys  
But in God are awesome splendor, love, and everlasting joys

**Tag**  
Gladly would I give to Jesus all affection, everything  
For the washing of His mercy  
Makes my ransomed heart to sing
