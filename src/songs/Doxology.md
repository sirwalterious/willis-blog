# Doxology

_Thomas Ken_

**Verse 1**  
Awake, my soul, and with the sun  
Thy daily stage of duty run  
Shake off dull sloth, and joyful rise  
To pay thy morning sacrifice

**Verse 2**  
Thy precious time misspent, redeem  
Each present day thy last esteem  
Improve thy talent with due care  
For the great day thyself prepare 

**Verse 3**  
By influence of the Light divine  
Let thy own light to others shine  
Reflect all Heaven’s propitious ways  
In ardent love, and cheerful praise  

**Verse 4**    
In conversation be sincere  
Keep conscience as the noontide clear  
Think how all seeing God thy ways  
And all thy secret thoughts surveys  

**Verse 5**  
Wake, and lift up thyself, my heart  
And with the angels bear thy part  
Who all night long unwearied sing  
High praise to the eternal King  

**Verse 6**  
All praise to Thee, Who safe has kept  
And hast refreshed me while I slept  
Grant, Lord, when I from death shall wake  
I may of endless light partake 

**Verse 7**  
Heav’n is, dear Lord, where’er Thou art  
O never then from me depart  
For to my soul ’tis hell to be  
But for one moment void of Thee  

**Verse 8**  
Lord, I my vows to Thee renew  
Disperse my sins as morning dew  
Guard my first springs of thought and will  
And with Thyself my spirit fill  

**Verse 9**  
Direct, control, suggest, this day  
All I design, or do, or say  
That all my powers, with all their might  
In Thy sole glory may unite  

**Verse 10**  
I would not wake nor rise again  
And Heaven itself I would disdain  
Wert Thou not there to be enjoyed  
And I in hymns to be employed  

**Verse 11**  
Praise God, from Whom all blessings flow  
Praise Him, all creatures here below  
Praise Him above, ye heavenly host   
Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost
