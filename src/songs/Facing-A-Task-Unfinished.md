# Facing A Task Unfinished

_Frank Houghton_

**Verse 1**  
Facing a task unfinished that drives us to our knees  
A need that, undiminished rebukes our slothful ease  
We, who rejoice to know Thee renew before Thy throne   
The solemn pledge we owe Thee to go and make Thee known

**Verse 2**  
Where other lords beside Thee hold their unhindered sway  
Where forces that defied Thee defy Thee still today  
With none to heed their crying for life, and love, and light  
Unnumbered souls are dying and pass into the night

**Chorus**  
We go to all the world with kingdom hope unfurled  
No other name has power to save but Jesus Christ The Lord

**Verse 3**  
We bear the torch that flaming fell from the hands of those  
Who gave their lives proclaiming that Jesus died and rose  
Ours is the same commission the same glad message ours  
Fired by the same ambition to Thee we yield our powers

**Verse 4**  
O Father who sustained them O Spirit who inspired  
Saviour, whose love constrained them to toil with zeal untired  
From cowardice defend us from lethargy awake!  
Forth on Thine errands send us to labour for Thy sake
